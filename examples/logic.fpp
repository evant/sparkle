Dear Princes Celestia: I can do logic!

Today I learned logic:
I wrote yes and yes. (to get yes)
I wrote yes and no. (to get no)
I wrote yes or no. (to get yes)
I wrote no or no. (to get no)
I wrote either yes or no. (to get yes)
I wrote either yes or yes. (to get no)
I wrote not yes. (to get no)
I wrote not yes and no or yes. (to get yes)
That's all about logic.
