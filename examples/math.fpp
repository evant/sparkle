Dear Princess Celestia: I can do math!

Today I learned math:
I wrote 2 added to 5. (to get 7)
I wrote add 4 and 6. (to get 10)
I wrote 6 minus 2. (to get 4)
I wrote subtract 12 from 7. (to get 5)
I wrote the product of 2 and 3. (to get 6)
I wrote 11 divided by 2. (to get 5.5)
I wrote 1 plus 2 times 2. (to get 6)
Did you know that Spike is 10?
Spike got one more.
I wrote Spike. (to get 11)
That's all about math.

Your faithful student: Twilight Sparkle.
