Dear Princess Celestia: I learned the elements of a good cheer:

Today I learned to cheer louder.
I said be louder using "yay".
That's all about to cheer louder.

I learned be louder to get a phrase using the phrase cheer.
Then you get cheer"!".
That's all about be louder.

Your faithful student: Fluttershy
