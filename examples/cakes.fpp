Dear Princess Celestia: I can bake many cakes!
Today I learned about all the cakes!
Did you know that cake has the names "chocolate" and "apple cinnamon" and "fruit"!?
Did you know that my favorite numbers had the numbers 1 and 2 and 3.14 and 4?
I sang "I can bake " cake " cakes!"!
I said "My favorite numbers are " my favorite numbers" and ok all of them are my favorites!"!
I said "but "" my favorite numbers using 3 " is pretty tasty!"!
That's all about all the cakes!
Your faithful student: Pinkie Pie!
