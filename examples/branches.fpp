Dear Princess Celestia: I cad do tree stuff!

Today I learned how to branch:
Did you know that a tree is correct?
Did you know that I am like not a tree?
When I am, I said "I'm a tree"!
Otherwise, I sang "I wish I were a tree".
That's what I would do.
That's all about how to branch.

Your faithful student: Fluttershy.
