Dear Princess Celestia: I can say what you say.
Today I learned how to say what you say.
Did you know that what you said was a word?
I said "Hello! What is your name?"?
I read what you said.
I said "Hi " what you said "!".
Did you know that what you said was a number?
I said "What is your favorite number?".
I read what you said.
I said "Wow! My favorite number is also " what you said "!".
That's all about how to say what you say.
Your faithful student: Pinkie Pie.
