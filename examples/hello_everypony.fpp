Dear Princess Celestia: I went to Canterlot Again.

Today I learned how to say hello to multiple ponies:
I said hello using "Rainbow Dash".
I sang hello using "Pinkie Pie".
I sang hello using "Fluttershy".
I wrote hello using "Rarity".
I said hello using "Applejack".
That's all about how to say hello to multiple ponies.

I learned hello to get a phrase using the name pony:
Then you get "Hello, "pony.
That's all about hello.

Your faithful student: Twilight Sparkle.
