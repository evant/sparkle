Dear Princess Celestia: I went to Canterlot Again.

Today I learned how to say hello to multiple ponies:
I said "Hello, Rainbow Dash".
I sang "Hello, Pinkie Pie".
I sang "Hello, Fluttershy".
I wrote "Hello, Rarity".
I remembered "Hello, Applejack".
That's all about how to say hello to multiple ponies.

Your faithful student: Twilight Sparkle.
