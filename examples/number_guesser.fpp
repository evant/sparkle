Dear Princess Celestia: I can guess numbers.

Today I learned how to guess your number.
Did you know that your number is a word?
I read your number.
I said your number.
That's all about hwo to guess your number.

Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.

P.S. This will guess numbers when parsing to numbers is implemented.
